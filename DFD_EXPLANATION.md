# Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Documentation - Dog Rescue System

## What is a Data Flow Diagram?

A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** is a graphical representation that illustrates:
- **External entities** that interact with the system
- **Processes** that transform data within the system
- **Data stores** where information is maintained
- **Data flows** showing information movement between components

DFDs provide a structured approach to understanding system functionality and data movement.

## DFD Notation Standards

| Symbol | Component Type | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Rectangle** | External Entity | Entities outside the system boundary (users, external systems) |
| **Circle** | Process | Functions that transform or manipulate data |
| **Open Rectangle** | Data Store | Repositories where data is stored and retrieved |
| **Arrow** | Data Flow | Movement of data between components |
